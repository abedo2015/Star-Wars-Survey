# Star-Wars-Survey
Is Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back really the best in the series?

By using the results collected from a SurveyMonkey survey, FiveThirtyEight collected information on which Star Wars film fans thought was the best.

The survey itself collected 835 responses, and our job will be to clean and explore the dataset for ourselves to determine once and for all what people really think of each film.
